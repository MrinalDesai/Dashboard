st.write("""A school is defined by its teachers. They shape not just the lives of students but also the future of the nation. In such a scenario, the quantity and quality of teachers matter. A student-teacher ratio (STR) acts as an indicator in determining the quality of learning. It refers to the number of students under every teacher in a school. It reflects how many students the teacher is incharge of in a school. It is calculated by dividing the total number of students by the total number of teachers in a school. It is important to be aware of the ratio as it showcases the workload of teachers and the attention given to students in particular. """)
st.subheader("#️⃣Optimal student-teacher ratios📌 ", divider="gray")
st.write("""Well, there is no perfect calculation of the student-teacher ratio, but the ideal figure  varies according to different professionals and experts. Typically, it has to be very low. 18:1 is considered and accepted as an optimal student-teacher ratio. It means that one teacher is available for every 18 students. Let us have a look at the ideal and recommended student-teacher ratio at different levels:

\n👉Preschool (6:1) is considered a safe one because, at this stage, a child needs lot of care and attention.
\n👉Elementary school: The student-teacher ratio here varies. Few consider 24:1, while others stipulate 30:1.
\n👉High school: Experts suggest 18:1 or 10:1. 
\nBut in India, the student-teacher ratio is different and worse than the ideal ones and low compared to the global metric. For example, in New Jersey, the student-teacher ratio hovers between 11:1 in private day schools and 7:1 in boarding schools. While in India, it is 27:1 in higher secondary schools. """)
st.subheader("#️⃣Factors influencing student-teacher ratio📌 ", divider="gray")
st.write("""The resources and funding of a school play a major role in deciding the student-teacher ratio. If there is a financial crunch, then the school may not be in a position to hire more or better-quality teachers. In such cases, they combine classes, overcrowding the classroom. This negatively impacts the students, as they feel unseen and unheard.

Class size policies and regulations determine the number of teachers per class. The availability of teachers is another crucial element that dictates the student-teacher ratio. India is facing an acute teacher shortage, with more than 10 lakh teaching positions vacant. Dismal salaries, improper working conditions, stress, and a lack of career opportunities have exacerbated the student-teacher ratio.  """)
st.subheader("#️⃣Challenges and solutions🔎", divider="gray")
st.write(""" Due to the very high student-teacher ratio, the education sector is facing challenges like:

\n👉Increased workload of teachers
\n👉Burnout among teachers.
\n👉Inadequate attention to students.
\n👉Deteriorated quality of education.
\n👉Poor academic performance.
\n👉Increased dropout rates, especially among girls
\nTo improve the student-teacher ratio, the following strategies can be implemented:

The government should recruit more teachers on a regular basis.
\n👉Increasing the salaries of teachers with regular incentives.
\n👉Addressing the underlying cause of teacher scarcity.
\n👉Improving the working conditions of teachers.
\n👉Providing career opportunities to teachers.
\n👉More people should be encouraged to take up teaching as a profession.
\n👉Supporting the schools with necessary resources like funds, basic infrastructure, etc.
\n👉The budget allocation for the education sector has to be increased.""")
st.subheader("#️⃣Benefits of lower student-teacher ratio📌 ", divider="gray")
st.write("""Less crowded classrooms: If a classroom has a handful of students, the students can understand and concentrate better. They can comfortably sit in the class without any distractions.
\n Improved individual attention: The teachers can devote their attention to each student, tailoring their needs and supporting them in their weak areas.
\nBetter student participation: In a small group, students can open up easily with confidence and raise their doubts and concerns. Students engage more and are more proactive, enriching the overall learning environment. 
\nReduced stress levels: Teachers won’t be strained much and will live with job satisfaction, improving their retention.   """)
st.subheader("#️⃣Parental and community involvement📌 ", divider="gray")
st.write(""" The involvement and efforts of parents and the community are significant in maintaining a balanced student-teacher ratio. They can support their children’s education by advocating for the recruitment of more teachers and giving regular feedback. Parents should communicate with children and help them in their studies. This will reduce the burden on teachers. """)
