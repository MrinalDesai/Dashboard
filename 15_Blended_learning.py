st.write("""Online learning refers to instruction that is delivered electronically through various multimedia and
Internet platforms and applications. It is used interchangeably with other terms such as web-based 
learning, e-learning, computer-assisted instruction, and Internet-based learning.It offers a wide selection of 
programs.
         \nOnline education enables you to study or teach from anywhere in the world. This means thereâ€™s no
          need to commute from one place to another, or follow a rigid schedule. On top of that, 
         not only do you save time, but you also save money, which can be spent on other priorities. 
         The virtual classroom is also available anywhere thereâ€™s an internet connection, and a good way 
         to take advantage of this is to travel. For example, if youâ€™re studying abroad and want to get a 
         job, online education is a great choice.

         \nâœ…It gives Trained teachers acess to more no of Students accross geographies.
         
         \nâœ…This means that states with Low/Teacher Student Ratios can access teaching manpower from other places
         which have larger pool of teachers. """)

\n Teachers need to spend more time in Teaching Activities. 
Only 19% of time is spent by Teachers doing actual Teaching.Blended learning does exactly negates this.
It saves commute time. Teachers only attend to student related issues and dont deliver lectures repeatedly.
It gives more one-on=one time.
It is an instructional methodology, a teaching and learning approach that combines faceto-face classroom methods with computer mediated activities to deliver instruction. This
pedagogical approach means a mixture of face-to-face and online activities and the
integration of synchronous and asynchronous learning tools, thus providing an optimal
possibility for the arrangement of effective learning processes. Blended learning is the
term given to the educational practice of combining digital learning tools with more
traditional classroom face to face teaching. In a true blended learning environment, both
the student and the teacher should be physically located in the same space. Despite this,
the digital tools used should be able to be utilised by the students in order to enforce
some control over the speed or topics of their learning. The flipped classroom model is a
similar program that aims to utilise technology in order to rearrange the learning
experience and maximise the effectiveness of valuable face to face time in the
classroom. 
\nBL shifts the teacherâ€™s role from knowledge provider to coach and mentor. This shift does
not mean that teachers play a passive or less important role in studentsâ€™ education.
Quite the contraryâ€”with BL, teachers can have an even more profound influence and
effect on studentsâ€™ learning. Traditionally, classroom instruction has largely been
teacher-directed, top-down, and one-size-fits-all, with a bit of differentiation thrown in,
but with BL, it now becomes more student-driven, bottom-up, and customized, with
differentiation as a main feature. Much of this new learning dynamic is due to the
enhanced role technology plays in instruction. BL provides an appropriate balance
between online instructions, which offers the interactive, tech-based learning,
individualized pacing, and privacy that keep students continuously engaged and
motivated, and teacher-led instruction, which personalizes the learning experience and
adds the human elements of encouragement, compassion, and caring guidance that only
teachers can give.
\nâœ…It Boosts Teacher Efficiency and Flexibility.
 âœ…It is Cost effective..

st.write("""\nIn a flipped classroom programme, students would be encouraged to access
digital learning materials via a cloud-based learning platform during their own time.
Resources such as video lectures, podcasts, recordings and articles would be provided in
order to transfer the main bulk of the necessary knowledge from teacher to
student before each class. This then frees up time in class for teachers to support
students in activities, lead discussions and facilitate engagement
