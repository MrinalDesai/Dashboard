st.write("""\n One can witness the amount of strain that will be put on Govt resources
         if it decides to directly improve the Teacher to Student Ratio.

         \nWe have established the fact that with time passing by Internet connectivity is 
         on the rise. Also with govt funding State Players this will improve even further
         in coming years.With Individual Content creatorss on rise this is even more benificial.

         \nWe need multipronged approach to solve this issue.
         \nIf Govt canâ€™t find enough trained teachers then the next alternative is to make the 
         best we can with limited Trained Supply of Teachers.Merely recruiting more 
         teachers will put tremendous strain on govt Resources. A report titled â€˜Involvement 
         of Teachers in Non-teaching Activities and its Effect on Educationâ€™ stated that 
         government teachers in the country spend a mere 19.1 per cent of their working 
         hours in teaching. During the rest of the time, they are either engaged in election 
         duties, pulse polio campaigns and maintaining mid-day meal registers. The report was 
         released by the National Institute of Education and Administration (NUEPA). According 
         to the report, only 19.1 per cent of a teacherâ€™s annual school hours is spent on 
         teaching activities. The remaining part of the teacherâ€™s time goes in 42.6 per 
         cent non-teaching core activities and 31.8 per cent in non-teaching school-related 
         activities and 6.5 per cent on other department activities.""")

        activities, about 23 percent to nonacademic activities (e.g., music, art, physical
        education), and about 19 percent to noninstructional activities such as transitions 
        between activities and class business. 
         \n2.Engaged time. On the average, students 
         spent 1 hour and 30 minutes (second grade) and 1 hour and 55 minutes (fifth grade) 
         actively engaged in reading and math activities. In the highest classrooms the 
         engaged time was about 30 minutes longer, and in the lowest classrooms it was about 
         30 minutes less than the average. 
         \n3.On the average, students were engaged about 
         73 percent of the allocated time in reading and math. Teachers with the highest 
         allocated time also had the highest engagement rates (about 82 percent). 
         Thus, within the limits of this study, increasing allocated time did not 
         lead to dimishing returns; quite the opposite, teachers who had more allocated 
         time also had higher engagement rates

        \nThe best three solutions are:
      
         \nâœ…Peer learning: This reduced the burden on Teachers.

         \nâœ…Flipped Learning Model:This frees up time in class for teachers to support students in activities, 
         lead discussions and facilitate engagement.
      
         \nâœ…Online learning: It remains another best alternative considering reach and access.

         \nâœ…Blended learning: It maximised Teaching efficiencey so that Teachers can focus more time engaing in
         Critical aspects of learning rather than just Delivering Lectures.

 All these three approaches remain one of most cost effective ways of Dealing with a High 
Techer to Student Ratio.

st.write("""\nâœ…Giving recognition to Online learning and Degrees and Certificates aquired through 
         online-mode, we can reduce the Burden on Teacher Resources as it would encourage people to pursue this mode of learning.

         \nâœ…Government should continue to invest in Digital Infrastructure as well as improve Broadband Connectivity.
         Funds should be fully uitilised and Vacancies should be filled in a timely fashion.
